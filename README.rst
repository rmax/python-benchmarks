Assorted python-based benchmarks
================================

This repository contains a collection of benchmark of interest.

Guidelines
==========

* A benchmark should have its own folder in lowercase with dashes. A benchmark
  must have a brief explanation and a straightforward way to reproduce it.
* External data used (i.e.: compressed files) should be stored under datasets
  directory, but data files must not be commited. Each dataset folder must
  include a script to reproduct and/or download the data files.
